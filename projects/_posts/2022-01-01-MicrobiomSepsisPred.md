excerpt: Prediction of Sepsis on the basis of microbiome sequence data

Goal of the project is to enable prediction of future Sepsis events by analyzing the patients microbiome. The project will create a predictive model for sepsis as well as identify a number of predictive bio-markers. 
By using shotgun metagenome sequencing the project aims to create an inventory of genomes involved in Sepsis as well as determine any possible antibiotic drug resistance. While the use of shotgun sequencing enables a deep 
characterization of a patients microbiome it is not well suited for clinical use, hence the determination of biomarkers that are more suitable for clinical use. 

The group will contribute the bioinformatic tools required for predicting biomarkers from metagenomes and complete genomes (MAGs).

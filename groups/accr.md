The __ACCR group__ headed by Prof. Dr. Florian Rambow focuses on resolving and perturbing cancer cell fate decisions to prevent 
cancer progression and therapy resistance. We leverage the power of spatially resolved single-cell approaches in combination with 
computational biology to investigate cell state plasticity and the contribution of the tumor microenvironment. Our primary aim is 
to advance translational precision oncology.

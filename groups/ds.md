The data science lab is part of the Institute for AI in medicine (IKIM), University Hospital Essen, Medical Faculty University of Duisburg-Essen. We are focused on efficient, reproducible and sustainable Data Science and Microbiome Analysis.

__Data science__ brings together a number of disciplines and methods for the purpose of extracting knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It strives to achieve semantic integration of data from a variety of sources and disciplines, suitable technical platforms for integration are required to facilitate the process. Related to other disciplines like big data and machine learning, data science is part of the value-add chain from data to information to clinical decision making.

Important aspects of data integration are suitable data exchange standards and data privacy, it is impossible to practice data science without good privacy and security concepts.

The group aims for honor the principles of Data FAIRness as well as reproducible science via the use of workflow technology.

__Microbiome analysis__ presents an opportunity to assist with the rapid molecular characterization o infectious disease via DNA sequencing, It can also advance the early detection of life-threatening diseases e.g. sepsis, NEC, dysbiosis in patients with bone marrow transplants. Combined with a data science approach microbiome analysis can provide vital clues for the detection of hospital borne infection and last but not least allow the establishment DNA base surveillance mechanism for the rapid and early detection of emerging DNA and RNA pathogens.

We are hiring PhD students, PostDocs and permanent staff, see our [job postings](https://www.ikim.uk-essen.de/jobs-en/).

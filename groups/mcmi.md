The __MCMI research group__ headed by Prof. Dr. Christin Seifert focuses on the transfer of fundamental research in machine learning, information extraction, natural language processing and semantic technologies to applications in the medical domain, and to oncology in particular.

We address questions relevant, but not limited to understanding and transforming clinical documents, sensor data processing, predictive modelling, medical decision support, explaining decisions of complex machine learning models, and devising interpretable, yet accurate models to foster stakeholder acceptance and trust. 

The MCMI research group is part of the [Cancer Research Center Cologne Essen (CCCE)](https://ccce.nrw/), the Initiative Network of Excellence in Cancer Medicine NRW.

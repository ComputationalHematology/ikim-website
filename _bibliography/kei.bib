  abstract = {Most of the microbiome studies suggest that using ensemble models such as Random Forest results in best predictive power. In this study, we empirically evaluate a more powerful ensemble learning algorithm, multi-view stacked generalization, on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and adult colorectal cancer patients' cohorts. We aim to check whether stacking would lead to better results compared to using a single best machine learning algorithm. Stacking achieves the best test set Average Precision (AP) on inflammatory bowel disease dataset reaching AP = 0.69, outperforming both the best base classifier (AP = 0.61) and the baseline meta learner built on top of base classifiers (AP = 0.63). On colorectal cancer dataset, the stacked classifier also outperforms (AP = 0.81) both the best base classifier (AP = 0.79) and the baseline meta learner (AP = 0.75). Stacking achieves best predictive performance on test set outperforming the best classifiers on both patient cohorts. Application of the stacking solves the issue of choosing the most appropriate machine learning algorithm by automating the model selection procedure. Clinical application of such a model is not limited to diagnosis task only, but it also can be extended to biomarker selection thanks to feature selection procedure.},

  abstract = {Network or graph embedding has gained increasing attention in the research community during the last years. In particular, many methods to create graph embeddings using random walk based approaches have been developed. node2vec [10] introduced means to control the random walk behavior, guiding the walks. We aim to reproduce parts of their work and introduce two additional modifications (jump probabilities and attention to hubs), in order to investigate how guiding and modifying the walks influences the learned embeddings. The reproduction includes the case study illustrating homophily and structural equivalence subject to the chosen strategy and a node classification task. We were not able to illustrate structural equivalence and further results show that modifications of the walks only slightly improve node classification, if at all.},

  abstract = {Models of human information seeking reveal that search, in particular ad-hoc retrieval, is non-linear and iterative. Despite these findings, today's search user interfaces do not support non-linear navigation, like for example backtracking in time. We propose QueryCrumbs, a compact and easy-to-understand visualization for navigating the search query history supporting iterative query refinement. We apply a multi-layered interface design to support novices and first-time users as well as intermediate and expert users. The visualization is evaluated with novice users in a formative user study, with experts in a think aloud test and its usage in a long-term study with software logging. The formative evaluation showed that the interactions can be easily performed, and the visual encodings were well understood without instructions. Results indicate that QueryCrumbs can support users when searching for information in an iterative manner. The evaluation with experts showed that expert users can gain valuable insights into the back-end search engine by identifying specific patterns in the visualization. In a long-term usage study, we observed an uptake of the visualization, indicating that users deem QueryCrumbs beneficial for their search interactions.},

  abstract = {Search engine users issue queries to formulate their information need and gain useful insights. However, it is challenging for search engines to understand different users' search type intents and re- turn appropriate results. Simulating user search behaviour allows information retrieval systems (IR) to parameterise the a-priori dis- tribution of search types using different back-end configurations and user interface variants to improve the retrieval functionality. In this paper, we propose a formal Markov approach in which we utilise the context discovery process to model user-type specific behaviour by capturing the user's query change in a search session. Contextual Markov models have been used in the past to improve the prediction of user intentions, we investigate here their effi- ciency in simulating user-type specific interactions. Additionally, we provide an empirical and classification-based evaluation that can be used in simulation assessment. Overall, we report that the proposed approach reliably simulates user-type specific behaviour on a real-world academic search engine log dataset.}
